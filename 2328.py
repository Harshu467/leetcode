# The code provided seems to be solving a problem related to counting paths in a grid. However, without a clear problem statement, it's difficult to provide specific intuition.

# Approach
# The code uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of paths in the given grid. It employs memoization to avoid redundant calculations. The countPaths method initializes a 2D array dp to store the number of paths for each grid cell. It then iterates through each cell in the grid and calls the solve method to calculate the number of paths starting from that cell.

# The solve method takes the current grid, cell coordinates, the previous value (for comparison), and the memoization array dp. It first checks the base cases: if the current cell is out of bounds or has a value less than or equal to the previous value, it returns 0. If the result for the current cell is already calculated and stored in dp, it directly returns the stored value.

# If the base cases are not met, the method recursively calls itself for the left, right, up, and down neighboring cells. It passes the current cell value as the new previous value to ensure that paths only move to cells with greater values. The results from these recursive calls are summed up, and 1 is added to account for the current cell. The sum is then stored in dp for memoization.

# Finally, the countPaths method returns the total number of paths calculated for all cells in the grid

# Complexity
# Time complexity: The time complexity of the countPaths method is O(n * m), where n and m are the dimensions of the grid. This is because it iterates through each cell in the grid exactly once. The solve method has recursive calls, but each cell's result is memoized, ensuring that each cell is calculated only once.

# Space complexity: The space complexity of the code is O(n * m) as well. It is determined by the memoization array dp, which has the same dimensions as the grid. The memory usage is proportional to the number of cells in the grid.

# Overall, the code uses a dynamic programming approach with memoization to efficiently calculate the number of paths in a grid.
class Solution:
    def countPaths(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        noOfRows, noOfCols, res = len(grid), len(grid[0]), 0
        dp = [[-1 for _ in range(noOfCols)] for _ in range(noOfRows)]
        
        def dfs(row: int, col: int, prev: int, dp: List[List[int]], grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
            directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]
            if row < 0 or col < 0 or row >= len(grid) or col >= len(grid[0]) or grid[row][col] <= prev:
                return 0
            if dp[row][col] != -1: 
                return dp[row][col]
            ans = 1
            for direction in directions:
                newRow, newCol = row + direction[0], col + direction[1]
                ans += dfs(newRow, newCol, grid[row][col], dp, grid)
            dp[row][col] = ans
            return ans
        
        for row in range(noOfRows):
            for col in range(noOfCols):
                res += dfs(row, col, -1, dp, grid)
        return res % (10 ** 9 + 7)
