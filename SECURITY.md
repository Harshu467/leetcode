## Reporting a Vulnerability

At LeetCode Solutions, we take security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any issues you may find. To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability. Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately.
2. Send an email to our security team at security@example.com with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
3. Include the following information in your report:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any necessary proof-of-concept or demonstration.
   - Any additional information or context that may be helpful.
   - Your contact information (email address or other preferred means of communication) so we can follow up with you regarding the issue.
4. Our security team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and work with you to assess and address the vulnerability.
5. Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution, unless you request otherwise.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you follow responsible disclosure practices when reporting security vulnerabilities. This means:

- Not disclosing the vulnerability or any related information to anyone other than the security team.
- Giving us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly.
- Avoiding any actions that could cause harm to the systems, data, or users of our LeetCode Solutions repository.

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and will keep you informed of the progress throughout the process.

Thank you for helping us keep our LeetCode Solutions repository secure!
